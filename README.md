# iOS Developer Essentials - TableViews [Video]
This is the code repository for [iOS Developer Essentials - TableViews [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/ios-developer-essentials-tableviews-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788299015), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
One of the pillars of iOS development is learning to work with a TableView. TableViews allow us to show a list of items to the user. We can see this in the Music app, the Settings app, Twitter, Facebook, and almost every app on our phones. This course will teach you the basics of TableViews, which are essential to making iOS apps in a fun-filled and engaging way.
We’ll also help you to strengthen your Swift skills along the way. 
We’ll dive into the topics of arrays, loops, and functions. We’ll show how arrays are immensely helpful when working with TableViews and are the backbone for displaying data. We’ll also learn how loops help us harness Swift to do an insane amount of processing that we as humans could never do. We’ll also cover functions which allow us to organize our code and make it more efficient.
Then we bring it all together in an Emoji Dictionary app. This app lists a bunch of emojis that we find interesting. When a user taps on an emoji, we’ll then show the emoji magnified to see all details. We’ll also provide a definition of the emoji to the user. This course will help you learn some awesome iOS techniques.
By the end of the video course, you’ll know how to build simple iOS apps using the TableView structure and also know the intermediate swift programming language.
